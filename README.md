  <i>A simple and smart way to detect phishing websites</i>
</p>


Phishing websites are fake websites created to trick users into sharing personal information such as usernames, passwords, and bank details. Many people fall into these traps because phishing links often look like real websites. This project, Phishing Website Detection System, helps users check whether a website link is safe or risky before opening it.

The application has a simple and clean web interface where users can paste a website URL and click the Check button. The system then analyzes the URL and shows the result immediately. Based on the analysis, the website is classified as Safe, Suspicious, or Likely Phishing, so users can easily understand the risk level.

The project uses a rule-based approach to detect phishing links. It checks for common phishing patterns such as insecure HTTP links, use of IP addresses instead of domain names, very long URLs, too many subdomains, special symbols, and phishing-related words like login, verify, or bank. These checks help identify suspicious behavior in URLs.

In addition to rule-based detection, the project also includes an AI-based analysis feature. The AI acts like a cybersecurity expert and gives an extra opinion about the URL along with short reasons. This makes the detection more accurate and reliable compared to using only one method.

This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs completely in the browser. It does not require any server or database, which makes it easy to use and deploy. The main goal of this project is to improve awareness about phishing attacks and show how basic cybersecurity techniques and AI can be combined in a real-world application.
