# 🛡️ NETRUNNER – Phishing Website Detection System
🤖 **NETRUNNER ** is an **advanced AI-powered phishing website detection system** designed to analyze URLs and identify **phishing, suspicious, or safe websites** using **rule-based analysis, heuristic scoring, and AI-driven reasoning**.

---

## ⚡ Project Overview
Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, targeting users through fake websites that imitate legitimate platforms.  
NETRUNNER provides a **real-time phishing detection interface** with a **cyberpunk-inspired UI**, combining **URL feature analysis** and **AI-based threat intelligence** to help users identify unsafe websites instantly.

The system performs:
- URL structure analysis  
- Heuristic risk scoring  
- AI-based semantic threat evaluation  

---

## 📚 Problem Statement
- Phishing websites are rapidly increasing and evolving.
- Users often fail to distinguish between legitimate and fake websites.
- Traditional blacklist-based systems cannot detect newly generated phishing URLs.
- There is a need for an **intelligent, interactive, and automated phishing detection system**.

NETRUNNER addresses this problem by combining **machine logic + AI reasoning** for accurate detection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect phishing websites with high accuracy 🔍  
- Classify URLs as **Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing**  
- Analyze URL structure and security indicators  
- Use AI to provide technical explanations for detection  
- Offer a visually engaging and user-friendly interface 💻

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Advanced animations & cyberpunk UI)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Fetch API
- AI Language Model API
- Prompt Engineering
- Cybersecurity Heuristic Rules

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User enters a website URL
2. URL is preprocessed and normalized
3. Multiple security checks are applied:
   - Protocol validation (HTTP/HTTPS)
   - URL length analysis
   - IP-based URL detection
   - Suspicious keyword detection
   - Special character and obfuscation checks
   - Subdomain abuse detection
4. A heuristic threat score is calculated
5. AI model performs deep semantic analysis
6. Final verdict is generated:
   - 🟢 SAFE
   - 🟡 SUSPICIOUS
   - 🔴 PHISHING
7. Technical reasons are displayed to the user
