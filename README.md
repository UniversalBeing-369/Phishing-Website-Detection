# 🛡️ Phishing Website Detection System
🤖 An **AI & Machine Learning–based system** designed to detect **phishing websites** by analyzing URL and website features and classifying them as **legitimate or malicious**.

---

## ⚡ Project Overview
Phishing websites are created to steal sensitive user information such as login credentials and financial details.  
This project uses **machine learning techniques** to automatically detect phishing websites based on extracted features from URLs and web data.

The system helps improve cybersecurity by identifying unsafe websites before users interact with them.

---

## 📚 Problem Statement
- Phishing attacks are increasing rapidly and pose serious cybersecurity threats.
- Manual identification of phishing websites is unreliable and time-consuming.
- Traditional blacklist-based methods fail to detect newly generated phishing URLs.

This project provides an **intelligent ML-based solution** to detect phishing websites.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify phishing websites accurately 🔍
- Classify websites as **Phishing** or **Legitimate** ⚠️✅
- Extract and analyze URL-based features
- Apply machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Provide a simple and user-friendly detection system 💻

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.9+
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Website URL is taken as input
2. Relevant URL and web features are extracted
3. Data is preprocessed and normalized
4. Machine learning model analyzes the features
5. Website is classified as:
   - 🟥 Phishing Website
   - 🟩 Legitimate Website
6. Result is displayed to the user
